more abc.txt | python readosfile.py | sort | reduce.py
execute above cmd in command prompt. It will give basic idea of map reduce workflow
Basically mapper programe read data from sys.stdin (system enviroment) then do the processing like assign a count as 1 to each word.
then reducer takes the sorted output of mapper from sys.stdin and then process it. 
finally result are written into the console output.

In summary: data is taken from sys.stdin here in above example we are passing abc.txt file as system input to mapper file readosfile.
Then output is sorted by sort key and finally reducer gets these data and process to count the number of each word.
